================================================================================
https://github.com/KeyboardCowboy/Cbase-Theme

Version 3 of cBase is a subtheme of Zen and will provide HTML5, responsive
panels layouts.

The goal of this version of cBase will be to create a minimal base theme,
stripping out the overabundance of classes and markup to create a more semantic
and low-profile theme layer.

Version 3 also introduces various external libraries:

- FontAwesome 3.2.0 (CDN)
- Zen-Grids 2.0.0-alpha2
- Normalize 2.1.1
- Typeplate 1.1.0
