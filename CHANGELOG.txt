--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a subtheme template directory.
- Altered the template.php process and preprocessors to not call out to subthemes
  anymore.  This was causing issues in variable scope if subthemes were
  implementing their own variables via the process and preprocess hooks.  A
  common function now should be placed in each process and preprocess hook
  in the subthemes.
- Renamed cbase_get_ancestral_info to cbase_get_family_info.
